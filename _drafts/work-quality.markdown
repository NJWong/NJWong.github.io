# My Work
I place a high importance on the quality of my work. I'm not the kind of coder that "hacks" together something to arrive at a solution quickly. I'm not saying that I don't see the value in this method - I know many people that make it work, indeed many of today's startups started with very bootlegged solutions (Groupon comes first to mind).

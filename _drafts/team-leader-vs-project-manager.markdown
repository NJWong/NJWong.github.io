#FYP Team Structure
At Monash, FYP teams are build around four (sometimes three) students. By this stage, we have at least three years of our software engineering degree behind us, so it's reasonable to say that most (if not all) students that make it this far are technically capable to be a software engineer. Learning new languages, tools, and frameworks is part of our education and this accurately reflects how learning in the workplace happens. However, one thing that is hard to teach is working together effectively and efficiently as a software team.

Often times in projects like these, teams don't fail because they aren't technically capable, they fail because they cannot work together as a team. It is not necessarily a matter of personality conflicts (although this is definitely a factor), it is more to do with the idea that they don't know how to work as a software team.

#Our Leadership Structure
The Scrum framework describes two special roles in a team - the product manager and the Scrum master. Neither of these are leadership roles in the traditional sense since Scrum teams focus heavily on members being self organised.

While self organising teams is definitely a team goal for us, we are not at this stage yet. We will be taking a two person leadership approach in the early stages of the project, to help with this transition. If leadership is spread over 50% of the team, then it is easier to transition into a decentralised leadership than if one person was the leader.

The two leadership positions we chose are project manager and team leader.

#Team Leader != Project Manager
To a lot of fellow students that I've talked to, team leader and project manager have been interchangable terms. The roles and responsibilities of both are completely different, and it is important to realise this.

The project manager is in charge of making sure schedules and milestones are set, but also that the team is on track to meet them. Essentially, they manage the project as a whole.

The team leader makes sure the individual team members understand their roles and responsibilities so that the team can work effectively and efficiently. This includes the project manager. They are the ones to lead by example.

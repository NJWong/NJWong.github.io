Motorcycle - feedback is important
Responding to change in conditions
React to events instinctively (good or bad)
Team leading involves leading by example, but also providing guidance
Feedback is a guidance technique - is an art
Feedback needs to be trusted concrete and constructive
Getting feedback from a person is not the same as getting feedback from a computer - people are living organisms ruled by feelings and emotion, computers are ruled by logic. If our code breaks, or a test fails, we do not blame the compiler or the test suite (unless we are having a bad day, or indeed the tool is known to be buggy, but in that situation you have bigger things to worry about anyway)
Negative feedback is disempowering and demotivating
Use the Praise Criticise Praise model (learned at ToastMasters)
Positive feedback is psychologically necessary for people to operate - support is a necessity not an option
Unnecessary or unconditional positive feedback eventually becomes insincere and just noise
Feedback should be contextual and concrete - if it isn’t then the person just walks away feeling congratulated not entirely sure what they did right and the meaning of the feedback is lost
If you are not specific it is not enough for them to learn what they did right, repeat it, and then build on it
Telling someone what is not good, does not tell them what is good - there is little they can learn from it
No entry sign for a road or car park - “thank you for telling me I cannot enter there - but that’s not what I want to know. Where do I get in?"
To be constructive you need to offer a concrete suggestion for improvement
Feedback should have purpose, and it should enable purpose

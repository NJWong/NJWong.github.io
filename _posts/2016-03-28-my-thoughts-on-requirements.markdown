#The Term "Requirements"
Call me picky, but I've never really been a big fan of using the term **requirements** in software projects. According to the Software Engineering Body of Knowledge (SWEBOK) version 3.0:

> Software Requirements express the needs and constraints placed on a software product that contribute to the solution of some real-world problem.

I don't have an issue with the definition given above. Far from it in fact - every project has *"needs"* and *"constraints"*, otherwise it both pointless and is not well defined. My beef is with the word ***"requirement"*** as, to me, it implies that thing is essential for the system to function. A requirement is either met, or not met - there is no in between in my eyes. If it is not met, then the system is missing an essential element and thus does not perform as needed.

#Requirements Gathering
Of course, there are some actual requirements (functional or non-functional) that are system critical. In these cases, I would be comfortable calling these elements requirements. But I feel using it as a blanket name for critical and non-critical elements is careless.

#Conclusion
At the end of the day, it doesn't really matter what we call these elements, given two conditions are met:

1. The information sufficiently captures the what the customer needs
2. There is a clear distinction between system critical and non-critical elements

### Definitions
* **FYP** - Full/Final Year Project

### That Project
Every engineering student's rite of passage. It doesn't matter if you're doing chemical, mechanical, or software, almost all universities end your degree with a final year project.

#### *Description from Marketing*
One last project where you group up with your engineering friends and put everything you've learnt from the past 3+ years to the test by solving a problem simulating the real world. This is a chance to show what you're really made of and prove that all the time, money, and tears spent was really worth it. If you do well here it means you are ready to transition into the *real world*.

#### *Description from the Trenches*
More accurately, it's the project that takes over to the detriment of your other units, social life, and (most importantly) sleep. By the end of it you emerge a wrecked husk, thinking to yourself "is this what it's like in industry?" and thus setting you down the path of self-doubt (assuming you weren't already on it before now).

Yes, universities like to do this to students. Monash is no different.

### In Reality
I'll start by saying that what I wrote above is based completely on what my friends and peers have told me. There does seem to be a common consensus that there will be unexpected complications you encounter during FYP.

The FYP experience really depends (among other things) on what project you work on, and what kind of team you work with. Even if you have a rockstar team and are working on a project that eveyone is passionate about, Life enjoys throwing spanners into your well oiled machine. I can say from experience that this is common for projects in industry too. Dealing with these surprises is a skill you and your team needs to develop.

That's not to say that you can't do anything to avoid surprises. Of course you can mitigate the impact these events have on your project - this is exactly why we do risk analysis and have come up with risk management plans.

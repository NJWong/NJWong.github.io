### *Useful Stuff*
* **FYP** - Full/Final Year Project
* **SE** - Software Engineering

### "That Project"
Call me sadistic, but whenever I meet an engineering graduate I almost always ask them about their FYP. I like seeing their reactions, and boy do I get a wide range of them. Here are my top 3:

1. The subtle throwback of the head accompanied by an eye roll
* (A.K.A *"I had to carry my team through it"*).
2. Their expression turns sombre, and with a downcast gaze they slowly shake their head
* (A.K.A *"I had no idea what was going on"*).
3. The sneaky smile with crossed arms
* (A.K.A *"You know exactly how bad that project went"*).

But if there's one thing everyone has in common is that they all have a few war stories to tell.

"That Project" is every engineering student's rite of passage. It doesn't matter if you're doing chemical, mechanical, or software, almost all universities end your degree with a final year project.

It's the one that consumes you - social life, study time for other subjects, and sleep are all thrown out the window. Goodbye work-life balance!

By the end of it you emerge a husk - a shadow of your former self, thinking "is this really what it's like in industry?" thus setting you down the path of confusion and self-doubt (assuming you weren't already on it before now).

Yes, universities like to do this to students. Monash is no different.

### Why Is It Like This?
I'll start by saying that what I wrote above is somewhat exagerated for the most part, and based completely on the number of war stories I've heard. I've yet to even start my FYP. However, there does seem to be a common consensus that at some point during FYP something will come up that leads to problems, and it's a slippery slope if you do not tackle them early.

The FYP experience depends, to some extent, on what project you work on, and the team you work with. However, even if you have a rockstar team and are working on a project that eveyone is passionate about, life enjoys throwing spanners into your well oiled machine. I can say from experience that this is common for projects in industry too. Dealing with these surprises is a skill you and your team need to develop. Unfortunately, it is a hard skill to teach (which is why most students struggle during FYP) so your team's ability to learn on the fly really dictates the outcome of the project.

That's not to say that you can't do anything about it. As a matter of fact, it should be a top priority to take steps to avoid being in these situations.

This is exactly why we get taught to do **risk analysis**\* and come up with a **Risk Management Plan** (RMPs) for the larger SE projects.  Responsible students will understand that doing RMPs (indeed, any type of *relevant*\** SE documentation) properly not only gets them good grades, but it prepares them before going into FYP. Sadly, many see SE documentation as a box to tick off as part of a larger marking scheme. A necessity to get marks rather than a necessity for project success.

This is evident in the typical SE student's mindset - *"I have to spend more time writing documentation than actually coding - I didn't sign up for this!"*. Whenever I hear this it hurts me on the inside. Not as much as *"Hey, if the code works, then it's done!"*. Even typing that quote was difficult for me.

I think partially this comes down to naivety and lack of experience. I don't mean that in a callous way - it's just that a lot of students don't have the experience (industry or classroom) that shows them the importance of good SE documentation.

This is not a criticism of how Monash teaches SE documentation. Of course the lecturers and demonstrators make a point that learning to write documentation well *before* FYP means you don't need to learn how to do it *during* FYP. Fortunately, that is enough motivation for most. Alas, we are only students, and what do students want in the long term? That mythical piece of paper to say we are qualified because we did stuff for 3+ years. How do they get that? Good grades.

##### \* I know that **risk analysis** means different things in different fields, so in this case I refer to the activity where you identify potential risks that can negatively affect your project.

##### \** Because not all documentation is relevant for all projects

Hello and welcome to my Blog-folio - a half blog, half portfolio put together by myself. Who am I? Well head on over to the ["About Me"](/about/) section to find out!

I will be writing a mix of "TIL" (Today I Learned) posts related to software development, as well as any personal/interesting projects I will work on.

I hope you enjoy!

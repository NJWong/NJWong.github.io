# Who am I?
My name is Nicholas Wong. I live in Melbourne, Australia and I study software engineering at Monash University. I love to write clean, efficient and maintainable code. To read more about my work ethic, check "this" out.

# What do I do?


# Why do I blog?
No particular reason - mostly because I want to :). I created this blog just before I started my final year of my software engineering degree so it's a good way to keep track of what I do and what I learn. For more information about the project, see "this" blog post.

# What will I post about?
It will be a mix of general "TIL" (Today I Learned) related posts, as well as any personal/interesting projects I'm working on. Plus anything I find interesting (like a cool tool or library I stumble across).
